If the Display all cards button is missing, you can run this in the browser console.
- displayCards(PictureCards.getAllCards(), 0)

For more information on what this does, refer to lib/PictureCards.js and lib/displayCards.js \
It is the same displayCards() that is used when the Pick cards button is pressed, but this time every card available is passed to the same displayCards with no selections (the zero value)
