# descriptions will not be upgraded anymore despite its half broken state. - 2024/01/07. Wish a late happy new year
Anything including both the program and the description there are written by me and is nothing secret. Meaning you can copy it, modify it or even publish it. And I will not give a damn about where you will put them or share them. In fact if you have a good use of it, I would rather you to have it as public as it can possibly be because chances are they are already covered in tarot books. As a result, this will merely be something that confirms to your senses and make things clearer to you. If there was bad things that were done with this knowledge, it would have been done already and it is already too late to withhold it. 

Just in exchange with the total freedom of the program however, I will not participate anymore in any religion nor occult. Including *And* *Especially* anything about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

The Tree of Life - Note that the position of 3 and 4 are swapped
Although the major arcana belongs to World 0 (Universe), we can divide them into 4 sub-worlds and one "trash" world that simply got nothing in it

Position 0: 
	- Cards: Fool
	- Does not belong to neither left nor the right pole
	- Revolves around the chaos rather than the order.
	- Gray, milky, trash area for the fallen
	- Does not connect with the inner Universe where other souls live
	- Destruction through inaction and procrastination 
	- Timelessness, time does not really matter
	
Position 1: 
	- Cards: Magician, Lust, Universe
	- World 1 - the bright light, spiritual and more astral
	- The light pole that connects directly with number 2
	- It is also the right pole itself
	- In the 00x place it represents figures more than actual people

Position 2:
	- Cards; Priestess, Hanged Man 
  - World 1 - the bright light, spiritual and more astral
  - Darkness in the form of the unknown, specifically about creation, therefore also revolves around conflict, unsure, and mental battle
  - The physical stays bright and therefore this is in the right pole
  - Govens more on mental issues than physical issues

Position 3: 
  - Cards: Empress, Death
  - World 1- the bright light but more concrete and stable
  - Stability in exchange of unknown conflicts and spirituality
  - The conflict in number 2 becomes more settle, defined and more robust
  - The dark pole is more concrete that comes from concepts that were and are still abstract

Position 4: 
  - Cards: Emperor, Art/Temperance
  - World 2 - The more concrete form of world 1. A settled world that is more realistic
  - Opposite polarity of World 1 but the same "position" of position 3
  - Basically the same thing from position 3 but given something that is more mature and lifelier than World 1. 
  - Life starts to attempt to go full in bloom in here

Position 5: 
  - Cards: Hierophant, Devil
  - World 2 - The more concrete form of world 1. The settled world that goes towards an attempt to become stable
  - We are aiming to finally shed new light to the living world around us.
  - It does not matter how things just come to place. With no rules at all trying to establish them, or to break the rules that became old.

Position 6:
  - Cards: Lovers, Tower
  - World 2: In here it can be look as concrete being even more concrete. However the cause and its effect take its full toll at this poisition. Means Devil is directly associate to Tower, and Lovers is directly associated to Hierophant
  - When finally the new Light takes place, we say that this is what is happening to us until we come to the next stage to settle with either the happiness, or the mess that was left behind.

Position 7: 
  - Cards: Chariot, Star (Date of the sun)
  - World 3: The first 6 are more about our survival instinct, but the 7,8,9 are more about something that we go beyond. We are always searching for things, and we will want to enrich ourselves with other stuff that are equally important as survival, so that we can use this layer to sustain the rest of the branches in return. Otherwise if we stop here, the whole branch will be killed.  
  - It said in here - Move on. Chariot is more personal. But star is more relevant to most people, as it relates to the physical position we are in in the Universe.

  Position 8:
  - Cards: Adjustment/Justice, Moon (Date of the Moon, relate to four seasons in Earth better than the western calendar)
  - World 3: Other than survival, there are other challenges when we start to develop. Overall it gives us an advantage over other animals simply because of our own "look empty" attempt that never appeared to be related to survival. But later, such "unrelated" task became our tool to survive in this world.
  - That was why there exist such position because not only we should physically adapt to something that looks completely different from the animal world, but we need to mentally adjust to it. We cannot just hunt for food. There's no place to hunt. Instead we now work in a factory to get money to buy food.

Position 9: 
  - Cards: Hermit, Sun
  - World 3: Other than survival there are other things we need to fact as a whole world. The One unit that keeps us and our lives enriched, and lifts the human race up to the top of the animal chain. 
  - Both cards are basically the same principle but one is individual and other is global.

Position 10 (refer to 0 for basic stuff): 
  - Cards: Wheel of Fortune, Aeon/Judgement
  - If Fool is 0, then both cards are 1.
  - A contentless space that mysteriously become content rich. Look down as to why we are here to survive, is something at the same time, sweet. Seriously, how did that happen at the first place? We needed none of that if our mind was really only about survival at the first place
  - This ones conclude principles from 1-9

----------------- Tarot generator rewrite v1 -----------------
Date started: 2023/10/19
Last review: currently in progress

NOTE: This is a overly brief personal tarot work I typed out from my mind, so it might be hit or misses. The work follows the numbering of the Tree of Life instead of other systems like numeology nor zodiacs despite the association of zodiacs and tarots. 

The program merely takes advantage of a random number generator to generate the outcome and no more. Description is only about the card itself and nothing else.

I don't want to put way too much focus on tarot work but on doing the programming properly as a programmer should. Hopefully my programming self learning will give me something nice and sweet in return, But still, because I had never share my tarot insight with anyone at all,  ---  

******This is NOT TO BE Published till the major arcana is completely done.*******
    
    
------ What the heck is this generator about ------
A rewrite and (hopefully) a WAY better organized program than the previous. Plus the website hosting there is not going as good as it used to be. I need to move my stuff here especially the programming codes

Tarot cards here follow the numbering system of the Thoth tarot deck, although the actual image I use might be from somewhere else


    - 000, 001, 101 etc are unique keys with certain meaning listed below:
      0xx - Major arcana
      1xx - wands
      2xx - cups
    - 001 - card number 1 in major arcana
      022 - card number 22 in major arcana
    - 101 - card number 1 in wands 
      104 - card number 4 in wands
      111 - card number 11 (knight) in wands
      112 -
       card number 12 (queen) in wands
      113 - card number 13 (prince) in wands
      114 - card number 14 (princess) in wands
    - â€¦ and so on

---------------------------------------

About Tarot (description part, programming part is over):
Tarot is like a very ideal story of a life journey of a human being, or even a group of people or race. There is nothing specific in here and it might even apply to animals. No one knows at what level do animals ride along with us in all kinds of journey, but I can say everything does. This is called a cause and effect. However those who refuse to continue theirs, they are free to do so. Some people never change even with time. So not everything is set. The bigger picture is only there to assist us with out journey, by providing an outcome so that we can understand ourselves better, and perhaps other people better.  

The four worlds:
This part is taken from the table of raw source. However once the tree of life reaches 4, it means the rest of the world. Therefore 0-3 are astral in nature and is more theory based, or conceptual, therefore serves also as a important foundation of the tree of life. 

Other numbers are basically the derived version of 0-3. Therefore when it reaches the rest of the world, 1-3, and sometimes even 0 (eg Wheel of Fortune), repeat over and over again
 
    0. Universe - the "basics"/Major Arcana that envelops the whole world, making the four worlds a whole One world
    1. Wands (fire) - origin, light, source, creation
    2. Cups (water) - base, thought, mind, sometimes matter in raw form
    3. Swords (air) - thought that becomes action, brute strength, cycling, rise up
    4. Pentacles (earth) - material possession that ties to the soul, the physical realm

The two poles of the Tree of life - overall white is spiritual, black is physical. Position 3 and 4 are swapped in polarity in this interpretation

============================================
World 0 - Major arcana (Thoth tarot order)
    0. 000 - Fool - The only card that has absolute nothing. "The world was without order and in chaos"
    1. 001 - Magician - 0 -> 1, zero as in nothing, to one as to having *something*, Creator of the universe, therefore like magic (genesis)
    2. 002 - Priestess - creator (1) and therefore creation, ie mother nature, the gods
    3. 003 - Empress - "emperor" on earth, taking care of the earth, the concept of earth, above the earth, heaven
    4. 004 - Emperor (repeat 3 upside down tri) - government body, the actual ground of the universal execution of all concepts above it. Therefore consist of only one body
    5. 005 - Hierophant (repeat 2 upside down tri) - spiritual fulfillment and unfilfillment, bonded dogmatic rule and restricted thoughtflow, spiritual concept being put in use and also challenged 
    6. 006 - Lovers (repeat 1 upside down tri) - perfection and essense like the light of the sun, both the spiritual light and the physical body coming into a harmony
    7. 007 - Chariot (repeat 3 link to Lovers as no1)- physical tool for travelling and taking the action of going somewhere else. Also an attempt to avoid being stuck
    8. 008 - Adjustment/Justice (repeat 2 link to Lovers as no1)- adjustment that is need to be made in the mental layer. Due to some kind of change from the outside.
    9. 009 - Hermit (upside down 1) - the dark aspect of earthly divine. Psychic and occult abilities. Down right to the unknown in action and its grinding and chewing up. Somehow resembles the dark side of a Magician (no1)
    10. 010 - Wheel of Fortune (0 and 1, 10 in Tree of life) - the first and a very harsh judgement of our own deeds but not exactly the earthly saying of "karma". Instead it is whatever effort or shortcomes we put into that became the fruit. From light entering into the dark (darkness, emptiness)
    11. 011 - Lust - (1 inside 10 ie fortune) - the most raw and unchanging push that drives all mundane creations, but in a quite unsatisfactory way. Also represents the constant thriving of the human race perhaps for nothing but an ego
    12. 012 - Hanged Man - (2 in 10) spiritual suffocation and a lot of trials. The middle road of spiritual fulfillment and needs not being met.
    13. 013 - Death - (3 in 10) being physically "dead" due to spiritually exhaused. Something that reducing to nothing and the failure of holding what was there previously, as if everything is falling apart
    14. 014 - Art/Temperance - (repeat 3 in 10) The attempt of pasting and putting things together in a random way. A color of mess that resembles the rainbow in an attempt to strike balance and harmony (negative card on its own, but sometimes diagram of the deck will dilute its negativity)
    15. 015 - Devil - (repeat 2 in 10) The mind being tempted by different things, contradictions and contradictory theories and practices that do not always want to fit with each other
    16. 016 - Tower - (repeat 1 upside down in 10) the beauty of falling apart condensed in the physical world. But the intense pain that also follows with it. Like heaven but down to hell
    17. 017 - Star - seeing "heaven" in its raw form, appreciating the world and seeing the beauty that one cannot really reach
    18. 018 - Moon - the part where things are always "like how it was suppose to be". A compliment that comes from the inside of the person. Something that "reflects" the Earth at all times no matter what. Probably name it Earth instead of Moon
    19. 019 - Sun - the complete unification of the world as sun is looked as the source of everything including time. The complexity of all understandings condensed into a fire ball that is so powerful that it lights up everything
    20. 020 - Aeon/Judgement - (number 0 in Universe) the darkest aspect of creator and creation. Therefore judgement is like going back to where we were and looking back at the present. Feels like the baby God looking back 
    21. 021 - Universe - (number 1 in Universe) Universe as it should be and always should be. We want 1s and not 0s

(PS: All the positions and things are still a mess and I'm probably only halfway or not even that close to the complete thing. But it's likely or not likely to be updated) 

Think of the 4 parts as colors. Four things that appears black shiny on top, white shiny at bottom. The left is yellow and the right is either red or green. The yellow represents the spiritual aspect of the world. And either red and green is like happy and sad of the world. 

For black and white part, these are basically figures or a representation. Or say, something that resembles either an object, or a figure.

It's more complicated than it looks. If you want a tunnel, place two mirrors facing each other in parallel. But this is just how the thing works.
